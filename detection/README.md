# Applying FEC to Object Detection

Our detection implementation is based on [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/) and [PVT detection](https://github.com/whai362/PVT/tree/v2/detection). Thank the authors for their wonderful works.

## Data

Prepare COCO according to the guidelines in [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/).

## Scripts

**See folder [cmds](cmds/) for training.**

## Checkpoints

We uploaded all the checkpoints to [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X7MhOpg50d1aAmWOP9M7psBhW_fJzg2A?usp=sharing). Feel free to download.
