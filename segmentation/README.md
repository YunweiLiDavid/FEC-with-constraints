# Applying FEC to Semantic Segmentation

Our semantic segmentation implementation is based on [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) and [PVT segmentation](https://github.com/whai362/PVT/tree/v2/segmentation). Thank the authors for their wonderful works.

## Data

Prepare ADE20K according to the [guidelines](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/docs/en/dataset_prepare.md#prepare-datasets) and [link](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/docs/en/dataset_prepare.md#ade20k) in MMSegmentation.


## Scripts

**See folder [cmds](cmds/) for training.**

## Checkpoints

We uploaded all the checkpoints to [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X7MhOpg50d1aAmWOP9M7psBhW_fJzg2A?usp=sharing). Feel free to download.
